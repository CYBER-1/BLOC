**Top 5 Keys to Success**:

1) *Commit the time*. Careful planning is my weapon. Even though I have a business and also take a coding class I'm sure I'll be able to find the time.  

2) *Avoiding lulls*. I'm a strong believer that if you try to learn something new you definitely should be on top of it. Study daily & you'll succeed.

3) *Make good use of my mentor*! - I always try to ask relevant questions to the subject at hand.

4) *Be Hungry for Knowledge* - always strive to find new information and solutions to problems. 

5) *Network & Collaborate* - find new ways to network and collaborate had always been a recipe for success.


In the words of **Henri Matisse**:
